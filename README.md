#National Tsing Hua University thesis template
##A LaTeX template which makes your graduation easier
###Get Started: simply import all the files on [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) and modify the main.tex and style/XThesis2.sty for your own contents. 
Besides the latex file, a book back for printing and four extra documents are needed for a formal graduation thesis: 1.博碩士論文全文電子檔著作權授權書 2.博碩士紙本論文著作權授權書 3.指導教授推薦書 4.考試委員審定書. Notted that thesis documents depend on the department you study.
