##National Tsing Hua University thesis template
###A LaTeX template which makes your graduation easier
Get Started: simply import all the files on [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/) and modify the main.tex and style/nthu_format.sty, acknowledgement.tex and chineseabstract.tex for your own contents. 


Besides the latex file, a book back for printing and four extra documents are needed for a formal graduation thesis: 1.博碩士論文全文電子檔著作權授權書 2.博碩士紙本論文著作權授權書 3.指導教授推薦書 4.考試委員審定書. Notted that thesis documents depend on the department you study.

This template is modified from a graduated lab-mate 蔡碩恩 in [IDEA lab](https://idea.cs.nthu.edu.tw/).
